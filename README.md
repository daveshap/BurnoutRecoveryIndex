# Burnout Recovery Index

## Purpose
This project aims to create a reliable self-assessment inventory to measure burnout without medical interventions. The Burnout Recovery Index provides individuals with an objective tool to assess their current level of burnout and track changes over time.

## Methodology
The assessment is based on:
- Likert-scale questions (1-5 rating)
- Bipolar question pairs (positive and negative framing)
- Split-half consistency to reduce response bias
- 12 categories of symptoms typically associated with burnout

This approach helps overcome agreement bias and provides a more accurate picture of an individual's burnout state.
